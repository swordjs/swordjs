<p align="center">Sword.js V2 - <b>Microservices</b> and <b>Serverless</b> very <i>small</i> and <i>fast</i> web framework</p>

<br/>

> A platform-independent web framework, based on WasmEdge, that can use TS/JS and even Rust to write business logic! Made for microservices and Serverless

## Features

- ⚡ Write high performance applications using **TypeScript**/**JavaScript**, even **Rust**!
- 🕷 Based on **Wasm** (WasmEdge) implementation of the Web framework, **so small enough**, **secure enough**, **fast enough**
- 🦴 **No V8**, QuickJS-based JavaScript interpreter, part of the API using Rust Rewritten!
- 🏠 Made for **Microservices** and **Serverless**, even deployable to various edge services (Vercel etc...)
- 👍 Compatible with part of the **Nodejs** API and can extend its own high-performance API to JavaScript environment!
- 🚌 Integrated with the fastest development/packaging server to date: **Farm.js**, which is even several times faster than **Vite**!
- 😮 It also has the best features of the first version of Sword.js, such as the file routing API, the plugin system, the middleware system, etc.

> In short, it is the next era of Web frameworks, occupy a very small, high performance, and can be quickly started and deployed anywhere; Promise me that from the next project, we will give up gin, nest.js, springboot and start to try Sword.js V2.
